                Do you remember Myspace? Myspace was previously the largest
                social networking website in the world from early 2005 to 2009.
                It had 100 million active users and was even valued at 12
                billion dollars. It was the most visited website in the United
                States and had a profound impact on the shaping of the social
                media websites to come.

                What made Myspace great? What led to Myspace’s eventual fade to
                obscurity? We believe that our society both values and demonizes
                superficiality and narcissism – and how did they play a role in
                the rise and fall of Myspace?

                What made Myspace great? Customization, the “Top 8” friends
                feature, the rise of the Internet celebrity all played a part in
                skyrocketing the popularity of the website – and, as Myspace
                essentially paved the way for social media, integrated all these
                qualities into the DNA of websites that came after in one way
                shape or form.

              <br />
              <p>
                The things that brought success to Myspace all hinge on
                superficiality – the same quality we criticize in both our
                society and social media. Is it possible to successfully connect
                with others without some level of artificiality?

                  Myspace was founded by Tom Anderson, Chris DeWolfe, and Jon
                  Hart in 2003.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 2006, Myspace became the number 1 visited website in the
                  United States, surpassing even Google.

                  >Today, the website is worth a fraction of what it once was –
                  its net worth is currently estimated at $110 million.

                <li>At one point, Justin Timberlake owned Myspace?</li>
                <li>...any other facts??</li>

            <div class="rightcolumn">
              <p>
                And yet, all the things that attributed to Myspace’s success
                also played a part in its’ downfall; holes in programming that
                led to customization also led to the SamyWorm, the impact that
                Myspace had on its users’ self-worth led to the cyberbullying
                and suicide of Megan Meier, and from there it wasn’t too long
                until the site’s demise. However, as established, Myspace
                pioneered social media and played an integral part in shaping
                how we view social networks. We as a society both revere in and
                condemn superficiality. So far it’s led to the rise of social
                media culture – but, much like its predecessor Myspace – will
                superficiality also lead to social media’s downfall?
