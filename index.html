          <p>
            Do you remember Myspace? Myspace was previously the largest social
            networking website in the world from early 2005 to 2009. It had 100
            million active users and was even valued at 12 billion dollars. It
            was the most visited website in the United States and had a profound
            impact on the shaping of the social media websites to come.

          <p>
            What made Myspace great? What led to Myspace’s eventual fade to
            obscurity? We believe that our society both values and demonizes
            superficiality and narcissism – and how did they play a role in the
            rise and fall of Myspace?

          <br />
          <p>
            What made Myspace great? Customization, the “Top 8” friends feature,
            the rise of the Internet celebrity all played a part in skyrocketing
            the popularity of the website – and, as Myspace essentially paved
            the way for social media, integrated all these qualities into the
            DNA of websites that came after in one way shape or form.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The things that brought success to Myspace all hinge on
            superficiality – the same quality we criticize in both our society
            and social media. Is it possible to successfully connect with others
            without some level of artificiality?

              Myspace was founded by Tom Anderson, Chris DeWolfe, and Jon Hart
              in 2003.

              In 2006, Myspace became the number 1 visited website in the United
              States, surpassing even Google.

          <p>
            And yet, all the things that attributed to Myspace’s success also
            played a part in its’ downfall; holes in programming that led to
            customization also led to the SamyWorm, the impact that Myspace had
            on its users’ self-worth led to the cyberbullying and suicide of
            Megan Meier, and from there it wasn’t too long until the site’s
            demise. However, as established, Myspace pioneered social media and
            played an integral part in shaping how we view social networks. We
            as a society both revere in and condemn superficiality. So far it’s
            led to the rise of social media culture – but, much like its
            predecessor Myspace – will superficiality also lead to social
            media’s downfall?

            Conclusion
          </div>
          <p id="conclusion">
            At the end of the day, our society rewards superficiality. Those who
            prioritize themselves, those who aggrandize themselves, are those
            who succeed. Myspace thrived off of superficiality, and now, so does
            every other social media network. Is it possible to use social media
            without falling into the trap of narcissism? People can technically
            use Instagram without posting photos, or Twitter without tweeting,
            but at that point, you’re not even using those sites for their
            intended purpose. Social media is built around the premise of the
            self.
          </p>
          <p id="conclusion2">
            Today, we don’t know if there is a way for a social network to exist
            or succeed while being devoid of all the superficiality we claim to
            hate. If there is, we haven’t found it, nor do we know where to even
            begin looking for it – or maybe superficiality has been the key
            ingredient to making social networks addictive all along.
          </p>
          <p id="conclusion3">
            After all, humans do love to talk about ourselves.
