      <h2>Top 8</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>The Top 8 friends feature was a feature implemented on Myspace that allowed
users to publicly rank their “top” friends and family and highlight them on
their main page. This public (but ultimately shallow and meaningless)
declaration of who was and was not important in your life understandably became
a social minefield. Were you in someone’s Top 8? What rank are you? Should you
put them at the same rank? What if you weren’t in your friends’ Top 8? <br><br>

As cruel as this ranking system was, users participated in it, and we continue
to assign value based off of meaningless standards to people today. We criticize
how brutal it was to assign a numerical rank to people based on their
importance, and yet we obsess over the social nuances that come with every
single move we make on social media. Should you unfollow your ex? Why isn’t
someone following you back? Will people think you’re rude if you don’t accept
their follow request? <br><br>

Today, we rank people and their importance based on whether or not they’re
verified, whether they have the little checkmark next to their name, and how
many likes their posts have. In reality, one’s value and importance as a human
being has very little to do with social media.
