          <p>
            Do you remember Myspace? Myspace was previously the largest social
            networking website in the world from early 2005 to 2009. It had 100
            million active users and was even valued at 12 billion dollars. It
            was the most visited website in the United States and had a profound
            impact on the shaping of the social media websites to come.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            What made Myspace great? What led to Myspace’s eventual fade to
            obscurity? We believe that our society both values and demonizes
            superficiality and narcissism – and how did they play a role in the
            rise and fall of Myspace?

          <p>
            What made Myspace great? Customization, the “Top 8” friends feature,
            the rise of the Internet celebrity all played a part in skyrocketing
            the popularity of the website – and, as Myspace essentially paved
            the way for social media, integrated all these qualities into the
            DNA of websites that came after in one way shape or form.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The things that brought success to Myspace all hinge on
            superficiality – the same quality we criticize in both our society
            and social media. Is it possible to successfully connect with others
            without some level of artificiality?

                The Top 8 friends feature was a feature implemented on Myspace
                that allowed users to publicly rank their “top” friends and
                family and highlight them on their main page. This public (but
                ultimately shallow and meaningless) declaration of who was and
                was not important in your life understandably became a social
                minefield. Were you in someone’s Top 8? What rank are you?
                Should you put them at the same rank? What if you weren’t in
                your friends’ Top 8?
                <br /><br />

                As cruel as this ranking system was, users participated in it,
                and we continue to assign value based off of meaningless
                standards to people today. We criticize how brutal it was to
                assign a numerical rank to people based on their importance, and
                yet we obsess over the social nuances that come with every
                single move we make on social media. Should you unfollow your
                ex? Why isn’t someone following you back? Will people think
                you’re rude if you don’t accept their follow request?
                <br /><br />

                Today, we rank people and their importance based on whether or
                not they’re verified, whether they have the little checkmark
                next to their name, and how many likes their posts have. In
                reality, one’s value and importance as a human being has very
                little to do with social media.

                Myspace saw the rise of the first Internet celebrities. As the
                first big social network, it was one of the first websites that
                tracked how popular you were, and helped catapult social media
                into what it was today.

                <br /><br />

                Tila Tequila was a model for racy magazines such as Playboy. As
                she gained popularity, she tried to join several social networks
                to connect with fans, but to no avail – her account kept getting
                banned for risqué. Myspace invited her over, promising to not
                delete her account, and from there it snowballed. Other
                celebrities that got their big break from Myspace included Jenna
                Jameson, who broke out of the adult industry, and Dane Cook, the
                first comedian to use Myspace to reach a larger audience.

                <br /><br />

                Today, the online celebrity culture continues to flourish.
                Celebrities have built businesses and empires by capitalizing
                off their personality, and the masses eat it up. From the
                Kardashians to Charlie D’Amelio, Internet celebrity culture has
                only gotten more prevalent and more insidious. They are only
                successful due to the encouraging of unhealthy parasocial
                relationships.

                Myspace profiles originally had a default page, but through an
                oversight of coding, came one of the website’s most beloved
                features: customization. Someone found out you could customize
                your profile page by inputting code, and soon enough, Myspace
                users began openly embracing the feature. It was a mistake, but
                was kept in as people loved the feature.
                <br /><br />

                And yet, the success of the customization feature only proves
                our superficiality. One must admit that it’s a little hubristic
                to look at a predesigned website and think, “I don’t like this.
                I want to change it.” Do we personalize things to express
                ourselves, or is it not just another form of self-advertising to
                the world? We want to set ourselves apart as individuals, and
                there is nothing more individualistic than a cool website all
                about ourselves.

            And yet, all the things that attributed to Myspace’s success also
            played a part in its’ downfall; holes in programming that led to
            customization also led to the SamyWorm, the impact that Myspace had
            on its users’ self-worth led to the cyberbullying and suicide of
            Megan Meier, and from there it wasn’t too long until the site’s
            demise. However, as established, Myspace pioneered social media and
            played an integral part in shaping how we view social networks. We
            as a society both revere in and condemn superficiality. So far it’s
            led to the rise of social media culture – but, much like its
            predecessor Myspace – will superficiality also lead to social
            media’s downfall?

                In October 2005, nineteen-year old Samy Kamkar discovered a
                vital security problem on Myspace. Seeking to exploit this flaw
                as a joke, Kamkar created a worm – a virus that replicates
                itself, automatically spreading through a network. It wasn’t
                malicious; originally meant to be a joke among friends, the
                soon-to-be-dubbed Samy worm added users who visited his profile
                as his friend, added a tag to their page saying, “but most of
                all, Samy is my hero”, and replicated the code onto the victim’s
                page, therefore continuing the distribution of the worm.

                <br /><br />
                In less than 24 hours, the Samy worm infected over 1,000,000
                accounts, completely shutting down the website, and soon
                becoming the fastest spreading virus of all time.

                  friends. I need people to love me. I delved into the bug and
                  found that I could basically control the web browsing of
                  anyone who hit my profile. In fact, I was able to develop
                  something that caused anyone who viewed my profile to add my
                  name to their profile's list of heroes. It's villainous. I was
                  ecstatic. <br /><br />
                  But it wasn't enough. I needed more. So I went deeper. A
                  Chipotle burrito bol and a few clicks later, anyone who viewed
                  my profile who wasn't already on my friends list would
                  inadvertently add me as a friend. Without their permission. I
                  had conquered myspace. Veni, vidi, vici.

                The Samy worm was born from arrogance and egotism. Though
                seemingly innocent, it identified and exploited the major
                problems with the Myspace interface, ultimately leading to its
                downfall.

                Megan Taylor Meier was born on November 6, 1992. She grew up
                battling depression and low self esteem. In middle school, she
                was bullied by boys for her weight, and harassed by other girls,
                before eventually having to switch schools.
                <br /><br />

                From there, things began looking up. She, much like many young
                teenagers of the time, made a Myspace account, and, through it,
                soon met Josh Evans – a homeschooled sixteen-year old. They
                became friends, and she quickly developed feelings for him,
                until he began sending her disturbingly harsh messages.
                <br /><br />

                However, Josh Evans never existed. He was a fake profile created
                by three women: Ashley Grills; Sarah Drew, one of Megan’s
                friends from her old middle school; and Lori Drew, Sarah’s
                mother. Lori made the account in order to see if Megan was
                making comments on her daughter, and the three shared the
                account, eventually pushing Megan to suicide on October 17, 2006
                – three weeks before her fourteenth birthday.

                Cyberbullying is an epidemic. Online, we tend to forget that our
                actions have consequences and we are self interested: we focus
                on what we want to do, what we think is funny, what we think
                will garner the most likes and retweets and attention – no
                matter how mean it is. We believe that we are entitled to our
                online hate and aggression because, at the end of the day, when
                we see a username, we forget that there’s a real person on the
                other side.

          <p id="conclusion">
            At the end of the day, our society rewards superficiality. Those who
            prioritize themselves, those who aggrandize themselves, are those
            who succeed. Myspace thrived off of superficiality, and now, so does
            every other social media network. Is it possible to use social media
            without falling into the trap of narcissism? People can technically
            use Instagram without posting photos, or Twitter without tweeting,
            but at that point, you’re not even using those sites for their
            intended purpose. Social media is built around the premise of the
            self.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, we don’t know if there is a way for a social network to exist
            or succeed while being devoid of all the superficiality we claim to
            hate. If there is, we haven’t found it, nor do we know where to even
            begin looking for it – or maybe superficiality has been the key
            ingredient to making social networks addictive all along.
            <br />
            <br />
            After all, humans do love to talk about ourselves.
